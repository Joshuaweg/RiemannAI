The wave function for the particle can be expressed as:\n\n\u03c8(x) = \u221a(2/L) sin(n\u03c0x/L)\n\nThe squared amplitude of the wave function is given by:\n\n|\u03c8(x)|^2 = \u03c8(x) \u00d7 \u03c8*(x) = (2/L) sin^2(n\u03c0x/L)\n\nHere, we have used the fact that the complex conjugate of sin(n\u03c0x/L) is sin*(n\u03c0x/L) = sin(n\u03c0x/L), since sin(x) is a real function. Therefore, the squared amplitude is also real and non-negative, which makes physical sense as it represents the probability density of finding the particle in a particular region of space.\n\nNow, to calculate the expectation value of the position of the particle in the box, we need to multiply the squared amplitude by the position x and integrate over the entire length L:\n\n<x> = \u222b_0^L x |\u03c8(x)|^2 dx\n\nUsing the expression for the squared amplitude derived earlier, we get:\n\n<x> = \u222b_0^L x (2/L) sin^2(n\u03c0x/L) dx = L/2\n\nThis means that the expected value of the position of the particle in the box is at the center of the box, which is consistent with our intuition. \n\nSo, you can see that while the squared amplitude is always a non-negative real number, its complex conjugate can be used to calculate other important quantities such as the expectation value of the position of a particle."
